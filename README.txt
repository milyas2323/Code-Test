I have go through with all code files, code formatting and structure seems good about logic it totally depends on requirements and at this stage the project files are not completed so i can't say anything untill i understand the project requirements completely, i just want to mention the way you have conduct this test does't make any sense to me because whenever i don't understand the project flow and requirements how can you expect anyone can change any single line of code, anyhow i have found some issues related to BookingController which further includes Repository controller called BookingRepository in which some class functions are missing as followed,

updateJob
storeJobEmail
getUsersJobsHistory
acceptJobWithId
cancelJobAjax
customerNotCall
getPotentialJobs
sendNotificationTranslator
sendSMSNotificationToTranslator

Overall code seems good and as per standard of Laravel.
